Building a Restful api
1. npm init in the folder and provide the keywords 
we get a package.json file 
Installing dependencies - we install express framework in javascript to make out task easier
We make a file called server.js to spin up all the code to set up the node js server

const http = require('http') --> same as import statement we are importing http package and it provides some functionality
const port = process.env.PORT
--> process.env accesses node js environment variables and this would be set on the server we deploy it on 
and if we do not find it we will simply host in on the 3000 port 

const server = http.createServer()
It takes a listener which is a function and it is executed whenever we get a new request and it is responsible for returning the response

server.listen(port) --> listens to server on the port 

app.js is created to spin up the express application which will make handling request easier

in app.js we setup app.use() as a middleware in which we pass an arrow function where we get some req, res , and next (special function which we can execute to move the request to next middleware in line )

we send a response by setting up the status code (200 is for everything ok ) and with the json response with the right header set up  which is string format 

and at the end of the file we do module.exports = app

now the app is passed to create server and the express application qualifies as a request handler 

and now when we run the server on localhost:3000 we get to see the get request
for post request we cannot simulate it easily on the browser 
so we are using postman


Error Handling: (important)
Point 1 : to not have the work of starting the server again and again when we are doing some changes we are going to install nodemon(package) - it is a package that will monitor our file and automatically restart the server when we change something
Add a script in package.json file to start using nodemon because it is not on our system

morgan package : logging package for node js - it is just a middleware used for loggin and by using this in our terminal we are able to get the logs
